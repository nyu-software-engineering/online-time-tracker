### Project Description
Introducing, Otter, a new platform to help you track how much time
you spend online. Information is gathered using a Google Chrome
extension, and then displayed on a beautiful and secure
password-protected website. Know exactly how much time you spend on
your desktop on the Internet. Use this information however you like,
it’s yours to keep!

### Short History of Our Beginnings
Internet companies often maintain a detailed understanding of our minds.
Google knows what we search. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat,
they know what interests us and with whom we interact. Amazon knows
what we buy. YouTube and Netflix know what we watch. With this
information, Internet companies can choose which information we see in
order to entice us to use their platform more and more. Because of
this, humans spend more and more time online. We don’t know how much
time we spend online. Maybe if we knew, we could make more conscious
choices about how we spent our time.
